                        As Martin Fowler wrote in his famous blog post, "Flaccid Scrum", many Agile Software Development efforts fail, because they do not adopt Agile Engineering practices, which are not covered by the Scrum methodology. Agile Engineering practices allow teams to accommodate frequent changes, while still delivering code that is low in bugs, and deployable at the end of each sprint.

                    <p>
                        This course goes beyond an academic discussion of Object-Oriented Design and goes into a deep discussion of its effects on practical software engineering concerns such as maintainability, testability and reuse. The course then proceeds to discuss critical Java best practices which affect performance and correctness. This is followed by a discussion on modern software engineering approaches of Test-Driven Development and Refactoring, which improve the quality and maintainability of the codebase.
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        Students are provided with numerous hands-on exercises, the most challenging of which is the final team machine problem, which includes changes to requirements mid-way!

                        The course culminates in a Code Review, where students present their solutions to the final machine problem to the class, for review and critique by the instructor as well as by the entire class on the basis of Object-Oriented Design principles and Java Best Practices. This activity has been effective in drilling-in proper practices and approaches to the students.

                        This course provides a rigorous introduction to enterprise development, including solving common problems of persistence, concurrency, organizing business logic, and communication over the web. It uses the core Java enterprise technologies of JDBC, Servlets & JSP. Regardless of which framework your team uses, this course is a valuable introduction to not just the underlying technologies behind the frameworks, but the best practices for dealing with common enterprise challenges.

                        Spring is a dependency injection framework that simplifies Java EE development and testing.
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        This course is designed for experienced developers who would like to gain more depth on Spring and building loosely-coupled and testable applications, as well as aspect oriented programming.

                    <p>
                        Java Persistence API (JPA) is a specification that describes the management of relational data. Hibernate is an open source object-relational mapping framework that implements the JPA specification (starting with version 3.2 and later).

                    <p>
                        This 5-day course is designed for experienced developers who would like to gain more depth on Spring and JPA/Hibernate, and learn about building loosely-coupled and testable applications. Students will also learn about aspect oriented programming and integrating with other frameworks.
