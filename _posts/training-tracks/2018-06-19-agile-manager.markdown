title:              Agile Manager Track
course_count:       4 courses
course_duration:    3 weeks
short_description:  The Agile Manager Track is meant to provide a wide view of the methodologies and practices available in Agile, and to which situation each is applicable. It also tackles how Agile values affect requirements engineering by immersing participants in the entire project lifecycle - from initial project vision, to user roles, and to the first iteration and release.

                                        Orange & Bronze is one of the first companies in Asia to use and advocate Agile Software Development. We have been using it since our inception in 2005, back when Agile was still an emerging movement.
                                    </p>
                                    <p>
                                        We are the first company in the Philippines to adopt Agile company-wide, and the first to offer Agile training and coaching. Through our training, advisory, and software development services, we have helped many companies transition to Agile approaches, as well as deliver successful, reliable products to market.
                                    </p>

                                    <p>
                                        In our 12 years of practicing, experimenting, teaching, and consulting, we have learned that many popular Agile approaches lack the engineering & process rigor required to build large, critical enterprise systems, which need to support thousands of concurrent users, huge volumes of data, complex, ever-changing, sensitive business rules, and high security standards. Filipino culture has also been a challenge in applying Agile.
                                    </p>
                                    <p>
                                        We have therefore evolved our own process, which is a combination of multiple Agile methodologies, as well as engineering practices, design patterns, and tool chain. This process is the result of lessons learned from our own projects as well as the projects of the clients we train and advise, and it continues to evolve.
                                    </p>

                                                    During the class, we try to understand your organization's specific issues and pain points, and share the various approaches that we or our clients have tried to address similar situations. More than just giving you technical knowledge, we try to arm you with specific action items that you can immediately apply to your organization.

The course then proceeds to discuss critical Java best practices which affect performance and correctness.

                                                    Agile Testing takes a very different approach to testing, which involves changes to software development processes and even system design. Testing begins from requirements elicitation, and is conducted in different ways and with different tools in system design and in coding.
                                                </p>
                                                <p>
                                                    Automated tests can be written even before modules are built. Also, functional tests do not break even with large changes to the UI, or even complete changes in UI technology.
                                                </p>

                        Orange & Bronze is primarily a software development firm. Our very survival depends on successful delivery of projects. Our approach to Agile training is therefore pragmatic, not theoretical. It is not just a discussion of one methodology or another, but an analysis of why projects succeed or fail, and which practices can address specific issues. We go beyond what is written in books and articles, and bring in our own experience. What we found out by applying Agile Software Development since 2005 is that many things written in books are not always applicable in the real world, and we bring this insight to our training.
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        During the class, we try to understand your organization's specific issues and pain points, and share the various approaches that we or our clients have tried to address similar situations. More than just giving you technical knowledge, we try to arm you with specific action items that you can immediately apply to your organization.

                        This 2-day workshop provides a hands-on simulation on effective requirements elicitation practices, inclusive of having effective discussions with stakeholders, translating vague business needs into specifications, writing of user stories & acceptance criteria, eliciting priorities & test cases, as well as basic Agile approaches to estimation and planning.

                        User stories help us manage requirements. It may seem easy at first. Following a "As a user, I want…" template seems easy enough. But how do you know if it is an effective user story? Does it need to be split or combined? What about the details? How do we know if the story is done? What about estimating and planning? This workshop aims to immerse participants in the entire lifecycle, from initial project vision, to user roles, and to the first iteration and release.

                        Orange & Bronze is one of the first companies in Asia to use and advocate Agile Software Development, and has been using it since our inception in 2005, back when Agile was still an emerging movement. This training course was developed and is taught by some of the Philippines' well-known and respected Agile coaches and practitioners, and uses the format trusted by some of the best companies in the Philippines.

                    <p>
                        As Martin Fowler wrote in his famous blog post, "Flaccid Scrum", many Agile Software Development efforts fail, because they do not adopt Agile Engineering practices, which are not covered by the Scrum methodology. Agile Engineering practices allow teams to accommodate frequent changes, while still delivering code that is low in bugs, and deployable at the end of each sprint.
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        This course goes beyond an academic discussion of Object-Oriented Design and goes into a deep discussion of its effects on practical software engineering concerns such as maintainability, testability and reuse. The course then proceeds to discuss critical Java best practices which affect performance and correctness. This is followed by a discussion on modern software engineering approaches of Test-Driven Development and Refactoring, which improve the quality and maintainability of the codebase.
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        Students are provided with numerous hands-on exercises, the most challenging of which is the final team machine problem, which includes changes to requirements mid-way!
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        The course culminates in a Code Review, where students present their solutions to the final machine problem to the class, for review and critique by the instructor as well as by the entire class on the basis of Object-Oriented Design principles and Java Best Practices. This activity has been effective in drilling-in proper practices and approaches to the students.

                        Most test-automation initiatives fail. Regardless of how much money companies invest in tools, testers often end up abandoning their expensive tools and revert to manual testing, complaining that test automation takes “too much time”. Tests are fragile - they easily break with changes to the UI, and are not portable across different UI technologies.
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        Agile Testing takes a very different approach to testing, which involves changes to software development processes and even system design. Testing begins from requirements elicitation, and is conducted in different ways and with different tools in system design and in coding.
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        Automated tests can be written even before modules are built. Also, functional tests do not break even with large changes to the UI, or even complete changes in UI technology.
