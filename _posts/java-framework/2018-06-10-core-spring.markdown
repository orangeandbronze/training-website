                                    <p>Spring is a dependency injection framework that simplifies Java EE development and testing.</p>
                                    <p>This course is designed for experienced developers who would like to gain more depth on Spring and building loosely-coupled and testable applications, as well as aspect oriented programming.</p>
                                    <p>O&amp;B is the first SpringSource partner based in the Philippines. Many of our engineers and architects have been using Spring Framework since its first stable release in 2004, and have built massive global systems as well as innovative products using Spring.</p>
