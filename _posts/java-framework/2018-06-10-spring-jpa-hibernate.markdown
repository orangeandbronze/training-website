                                    <p>Spring is a dependency injection framework that simplifies Java EE development and testing.</p>
                                    <p>Java Persistence API (JPA) is a specification that describes the management of relational data. Hibernate is an open source object-relational mapping framework that implements the JPA specification.</p>
                                    <p>This combined 5-day course enhances the 3-day Core Spring course with topics to cover JPA/Hibernate basic and advanced concepts. This is designed for experienced developers who would like to gain a solid foundation in JPA, and use it effectively within the Spring framework.</p>
