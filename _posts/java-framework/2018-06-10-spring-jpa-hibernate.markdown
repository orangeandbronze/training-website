                                    <p>Spring is a dependency injection framework that simplifies Java EE development and testing.</p>
                                    <p>This course is designed for experienced developers who would like to gain more depth on Spring and building loosely-coupled and testable applications, as well as aspect oriented programming.</p>
                                    <p>Java Persistence API (JPA) is a specification that describes the management of relational data. Hibernate is an open source object-relational mapping framework that implements the JPA specification (starting with version 3.2 and later).</p>
                                    <p>This 5-day course is designed for experienced developers who would like to gain more depth on Spring and JPA/Hibernate, and learn about building loosely-coupled and testable applications. Students will also learn about aspect oriented programming and integrating with other frameworks.</p>
                                    <h4>Benefits of the Program</h4>
                                    <p>Trainees will learn to do the following:</p>
