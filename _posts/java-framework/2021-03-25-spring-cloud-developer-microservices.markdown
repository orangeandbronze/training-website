                                    <p>Microservices is a software and organization pattern for delivering business value quickly. Spring Boot and Spring Cloud are a powerful combination for building modern microservices architectures that leverage industry-tested technology like distributed configuration, services discovery and circuit breakers.</p>
                                    <p>The 2-day Spring Cloud Developer course provides participants with a background on why Cloud Native and microservices are important to adding business value quickly. The course leverages Spring Boot and Spring Cloud to solve the challenges associated with running a distributed, microservice-based architecture.</p>
