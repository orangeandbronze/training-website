                                    <p>This 2-day workshop provides a hands-on simulation on effective requirements elicitation practices, inclusive of having effective discussions with stakeholders, translating vague business needs into specifications, writing of user stories & acceptance criteria, eliciting priorities & test cases, as well as basic Agile approaches to estimation and planning.</p>
                                    <p>User stories help us manage requirements. It may seem easy at first. Following a "As a user, I wantâ€¦" template seems easy enough. But how do you know if it is an effective user story? Does it need to be split or combined? What about the details? How do we know if the story is done? What about estimating and planning? This workshop aims to immerse participants in the entire lifecycle, from initial project vision, to user roles, and to the first iteration and release.</p>
                                    <h4>From this workshop, trainees will learn</h4>
