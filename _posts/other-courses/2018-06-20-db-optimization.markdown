                                        Database performance problems are often impossible to catch through manual testing during development, or even in the first few months of production. They usually manifest themselves only one or more years after the end of a project, when the original developers have moved on and any warranties have expired. These often lead to serious financial and reputational damage to businesses, and finding and fixing problems can take weeks if not months.
