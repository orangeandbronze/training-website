                                    <p>Design Patterns are recurring software design solutions that can be used to improve new or existing applications. The course teaches both the foundational (aka Gang of Four or GoF) design patterns as well as the Enterprise Application design patterns which focus on building enterprise applications, covering such topics as designing web components, business logic, and persistence.</p>
                                    <p>This training course was developed and is taught by some of the Philippines' well-known and respected Java software engineers and architects, and uses the format trusted by some of the best companies in the Philippines.</p>
