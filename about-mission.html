                            At O&B, our mantra is "adopt best practices and share them with others". We developed our training programs with this in mind. Through O&B University, we teach lessons based on practical knowledge and share what we learned from our experience in real-world projects.

                            Our instructors are exposed to and immersed in O&B's software development projects - whether in a leadership capacity, project scoping role, or doing actual development work. We believe that to teach effectively, one must actually do the work.

                            Our training courses are rich with quizzes, case studies, and machine problems. This is to ensure that participants immediately apply what they learn and retain the knowledge.
