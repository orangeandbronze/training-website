                    O&B has built a reputation on hiring and training skilled software engineers. We have experience developing enterprise applications using Java, Spring, Hibernate, and other related technologies both for local and overseas clientele. Our real-world experiences are applied to our training programs. Because we are practicing engineers, we are updated on the latest on Java technology and constantly update our curriculum and materials.
